Welcome to the **biu** issue tracker! To keep development moving smoothly, please read the following guidelines before opening a new issue.
## 1. Search First
Before opening a new issue, please search existing issues (both Open and Closed) to see if your problem or feature request has already been reported.
- If you find a match, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a duplicate.
## 2. Reporting Bugs
If you are reporting a bug, please ensure you use the **Bug Report Template**.
- Isolate the issue: Confirm the bug is caused by biu code and not a local configuration error.
- Plugins: This project uses specific plugins (vFolders, Hot Reload, etc.). If you suspect a bug comes directly from a third-party package, check their documentation or repositories first, but feel free to log it here if it breaks our specific implementation.
- Logs: Always include Unity Console logs or stack traces.
***Note: This project is under heavy construction, so bug issues may not be fixed until late cycle of development. 
## 3. Feature Requests
We welcome ideas! Use the **Feature Request Template**.
- Before you add features, you should discuss it in the [Discussion](https://github.com/WMsans/biu/discussions) portion. 
- Focus on features that align with the core gameplay loop or current development roadmap.
- Be specific about how it should work.
## 4. Art & Assets
For artists and animators, use the **Art Asset Task Template**.
- Check the current asset naming conventions (e.g., spr_player_idle) before uploading or requesting files.
## Code of Conduct
- Be respectful and constructive.
- Keep discussions relevant to the specific issue.
